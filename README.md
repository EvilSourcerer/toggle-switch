# C# Toggle Switch

The Winforms Toggle Switch is a custom control you can import into your toolbox. It is designed to have a flat modern feel to it to make it feel as professional as possible.

## How to Use

To download to custom control, navigate to the following path :
```

```
Click "View Raw", and the dll file will automatically download.


### Prerequisites

You will need the following to be able to use this control : 
* .NET Framework 
* Windows OS

### Installing

Then, open your toolbox, and then right click on any section of the toolbox and then select **CHOOSE ITEMS**. A window will appear. It will load all of the controls imported. Click the "Browse" button in the window, and find the DLL file you downloaded. Select it and click **Open**. You should now be able to drag the Toggle Switch into the form and program it.
